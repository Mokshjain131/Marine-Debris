print("   - Current Performance: 71.6% accuracy, but 0% precision/recall")
print("   - Problem: Model predicts 'no debris' for almost everything")
print("   - Cause: Likely class imbalance or wrong threshold (0.5)")

print("Option 1: Fix ResNet18 Classification Model (RECOMMENDED)")
print("  Benefits:")
print("    - Already trained for classification task")
print("    - Just needs threshold tuning or retraining")
print("    - Fast and straightforward")
print("  Next steps:")
print("    a) Try lower thresholds (0.3, 0.2) instead of 0.5")
print("    b) Check if model was trained with class weights")
print("    c) Consider retraining with better class balancing")

print("\nOption 2: Convert Segmentation to Classification")
print("  Process:")
print("    - Load MarineXT segmentation model")
print("    - Get pixel-level predictions (256x256)")
print("    - Count pixels classified as 'Marine Debris'")
print("    - If >X% pixels are debris, classify image as 'has debris'")
print("  Challenges:")
print("    - Requires full MarineXT architecture code")
print("    - Need to determine optimal pixel threshold")
print("    - Slower than direct classification")
print("    - May not be accurate for sparse debris")

print("\nOption 3: Train New Classification Model")
print("  - Train ResNet18 with proper class weighting")
print("  - Use data augmentation for minority class")
print("  - Try different loss functions (Focal Loss, etc.)")

print("\n### IMMEDIATE ACTION ###\n")
